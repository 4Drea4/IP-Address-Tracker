#### Scope: 
The challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, I will be using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

### User Experience:
1. Users will be able to see their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load.
2. Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location.
3. View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
4. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

#### Plan: 
    Pre-Plan: 
        From a high level overview this project will require:
        1. For a user to give an input
        2. Call on the Api
        3. Display the data from the API which will require object mapping
        4. There will be a need to show the location on a map
